## Executive Summary
The primary objective of this project was to transform data exported from a point-of-sale (POS) system with restrictive reporting capabilities to uncover insights into top-selling products, sales revenue drivers, retail metrics, and customer retention and lifetime revenue. The store was experiencing a drop in monthly sales revenue, and a deeper dive into the data might provide actionable insights.  The data was transformed into a SQL database and Tableau dashboard.  Recommendations focus on enhancing customer retention through targeted marketing strategies and loyalty programs.

## **Project Overview**

### Motivation

Zero-waste grocery stores are gaining popularity as environmentally-conscious consumers seek to reduce packaging waste. These stores sell items like grains, nuts, and cleaning supplies in bulk, encouraging customers to bring their reusable containers. The trend is driven by growing sustainability awareness and a desire to combat plastic pollution and waste in landfills. Most stores are locally owned small businesses with limited options for affordable point-of-sale (POS) solutions that can handle bring-your-own-container weighed checkout. 

The Zero-waste grocery in this case study had implemented Revel Systems POS.  Customers loved the checkout experience, but the back-end reporting capabilities were minimal.  In 2021, sales began to decline after significant month-over-month growth throughout 2020.  The store has a solid social media presence, with close to 9k followers on Instagram.  The store owners hoped to leverage the data in the POS system to seek additional insights and drive strategy to restore sales growth. 

### Scope

This project analyzes POS data from a single zero-waste grocery store from its grand opening in early 2019 through the end of 2021.  

### **Objective**

By transforming the data into an SQL database and building interactive Tableau dashboards, store ownership can develop a data-informed strategy for the future. The store hoped to gain insights into the marketâ€™s top-selling products, sales revenue drivers, retail metrics, customer retention, and lifetime revenue.  This information will set benchmarks and build the foundation for a new customer retention approach.

### **Tools, Skills, and Methodologies**

The project leveraged Excel and Power Query for data preparation, SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) for database creation and data cleaning, Azure Data Studio notebooks for analysis, and Tableau for data visualization.

### Data Overview

The data includes POS transactions from 2019 through 2021.  

**Annual Sales Transactions:**  Three Excel files of sales transactions, one for each calendar year, with ~220k lines in total.  The data includes order date and time, order ID, customer information, product ID, quantity, unit price, extended cost, and extended price.  

**Product List:**  An Excel product listing file, including product ID, product category, product subcategory, product name, product cost, and product price.

The results of this analysis are shared with the store owner's consent, but the underlying source data remains private at this time and is not shared in public repositories.
